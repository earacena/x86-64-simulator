Project title: x86_64 CPU simulator
Author: Emanuel Aracena
Description: A simple, abstracted, CPU simulator that demonstrates concepts like paging, virtual memory,
             and bus communication in x86_64 hardware.

To run unit tests on each component, in terminal type:
    python3 (>>> means inside python environment)
    >>> import component (without the .py extension)
    >>> component.main()

All components except for gui.py and bus.py contain a unit test.

To run, type:
    python3 main.py
